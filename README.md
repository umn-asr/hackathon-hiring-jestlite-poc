# Bob javascript pairing exercise

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He retorts 'Calm down, I know what I'm doing!' if you yell a question at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

## How to run the tests

Open the file index.html in a browser.  It will automatically run the tests and
output the results in the page.  You can then write inline javascript on the
page to get the tests to pass.  The page does not automatically detect
modifications to the javascript source, so after making changes you will need
to refresh the page to see your changes.
